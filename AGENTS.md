Detailed documentation with instructions for modding to forge 1.20.1 can be found in the acairsoriginssecundus directory
/Documentation/. 
To write a mod, please read all the instructions inside the Documentation folder in detail.
You write the code for the mod and the user creates the textures later. Explain where and how to add after and create temporary textures from primitive shapes, to indicate their future location, as well as check the performance of the mod and visual mocap.
